    <h1>Non-Admin Strike System</h1>

    <h4>Warning</h4>
    <p>Warnings will be given at the discretion of the admin team if we feel a rule is unintentionally being violated or there is undesirable behavior that may not specifically fall under the rules. 
        A warning will typically be a PM either in game or through Discord explaining what's going on and how to fix the issue.  If a warning has already been issued for the same offense a strike will be issued instead.  
        Admins reserve the right to skip the warning and issue an immediate strike if the issue is severe. </p>
    <h4>First Strike - Suspension</h4>
    <p>You will receive a temporary demotion from your current rank.  During this time you are expected to continue to be a part of the clan community and continue to be an active member.  This will be reviewed by the admin team.</p>
    
    <h4>Second Strike - Demotion</h4>
    <p>You will be permanently demoted from your current rank and this could possibly result in a mute in the clan and in the discord channel for a period of time.
        During this time you are expected to be more active in clan by helping others, asking questions and engaging in clan activities/events.  This will be reviewed by the founders/keys.</p>
    
    <h4>Third Strike - Removal</h4>
    <p>You will be removed from the clan immediately both in game and in the Discord server.</p>


    <h1>Admin Strike System</h1>

    <h4>First Strike - Suspension</h4>
    <p>You will receive a temporary demotion from your current rank.  During this time you are expected to continue to be a part of the clan community by participating/hosting events and improve your leadership skills. This will be reviewed by the founders/keys.</p>
    
    <h4>Second Strike - Demotion</h4>
    <p>You will be permanently demoted from your current rank.  During this time you are expected to be more active in clan activities and events.
        More engagement in the clan community is vital and shows your commitment to the clan.  This will be reviewed by the founders/keys.</p>
    
    <h4>Third Strike - Removal</h4>
    <p>You will be removed from the Admin team and will be demoted to the General rank.  You will remain at this rank for at least 6 months before being considered for another promotion.
        This will be reviewed by the founders/keys.</p>

    <h1>How Do I Receive a Strike?</h1>
    <p>Inactivity or Breaking Rules
        The admin team or founders/keys can issue a strike against you if you have been inactive for a period of 3+ months or you have broken any rules in the rule book under "Strike-Based System"</p>
    <h1>When will the Review Occur?</h1>
    <p>Quarterly Reviews
        Ever 3 months, the Admin+ team will have a quarterly review.  During this time we will review each member of the team and make changes according to strikes or need based on each ranking.
        This is a time to bring forward any challenges you are facing, policies that need to be changed/implemented and clanmates you are vouching for promotion.</p>
