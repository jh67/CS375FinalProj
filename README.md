Final project for CS375

Avoid pushing the following files/folders onto repository:
env.json
package-lock.json
package.json
node_modules

This should not be an issue, as these files will be one directory above the repository

Work-In-Progress/To-be-implemented later:
rules.html will be the page that houses the rules/rankings.
skill.html will redirect to Official Runescape Wiki.
events.html will be the house the previous events/flyers/etc.
scrapbook.html will be a gallery of photos submitted by members.

Completed/Soon-to-be-completed:
index.html is the homepage of the website.
market.html + market.js houses the marketplace that calls upon a database that stores listings and can add listings.

This repository houses the code that will be deployed on AWS. If you would like a local version to run with node, a branch will be created in the future (3/16/2022).
