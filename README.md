Final project for CS375

Avoid pushing the following files/folders onto repository:
env.json
package-lock.json
package.json
node_modules

This should not be an issue, as these files will be one directory above the repository

Work-In-Progress/To-be-implemented later:
calendar.html will be the page that houses the calendar of events.
rulesValues.html will be the page that houses the rules/rankings.
meetTheClan.html will be the short about me page.
pvm.html will contain our "personal" wiki (Just a long text file for now).
skill.html will redirect to Official Runescape Wiki.
eventArchive.html will be the house the previous events/flyers/etc.
scrapbook.html will be a gallery of photos submitted by members.

Completed/Soon-to-be-completed:
index.html is the homepage of the website.
market.html + market.js houses the marketplace that calls upon a database that stores listings and can add listings.
